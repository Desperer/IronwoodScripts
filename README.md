# IronwoodTracker    
NOTE: This script has not been updated for new features in Ironwood's 1.0 release, but basic tracking for most skills should still work. Most other features have been largely superceded by the fantastic [Pancake-Scripts](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/475356-ironwood-rpg-pancake-scripts)

Track useful action stats in [Ironwood RPG](https://ironwoodrpg.com/).

### Features

- Tracks resource gain and consumption in combat, gathering, and crafting.
- Calculates ETA for next level up and next resource tier.
- Saves tracked stats for easy side-by-side comparison
- Toggleable sound alerts for rare item drops, actions stopping, and quest completion.
- Minimizes out of the way when not in use, perfect for smaller screens.

### Usage Tips

- Hover over buttons to see a short description of what they do.
- For most accurate results, click &#8634; to start the tracker immediately after clicking the "Start Action" button.
- Dismissing a rare drop alert turns them off until the game is refreshed - restart your action and refresh the game to receive further alerts.
