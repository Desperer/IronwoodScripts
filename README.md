### Features

- Tracks resource gain and consumption in both combat, gathering, and crafting.
- Shows ETA for next level up and next resource tier.
- Save a temporary copy of tracked stats for easy comparisons.
- Plays sound alerts for rare item drops, or when the player/home automations are idling (configurable).
- Minimizes out of the way when not in use, perfect for smaller screens.

### Usage Tips

- Hover over buttons to see a short description of what they do.
- For most accurate results, click &#8634; to start the tracker immediately after clicking the "Start Action" button.
- Clicking the rare drop notification silences it until &#8634; is clicked again, so it is recommended that you restart your action and the tracker if you wish to be alerted of future drops.
